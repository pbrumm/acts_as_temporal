This is a clone of the acts_as_versioned git project.  I am in the process of adding in temporal logic.  

It stores the effective_start and effective_end dates of records so that the version history can be searched for what happened at an exact point in history.  

Below is the details for acts_as_versioned which still works today.

Will soon rename methods to get them more inline with the temporal nature of things.

= acts_as_versioned

This library adds simple versioning to an ActiveRecord module.  ActiveRecord is required.
